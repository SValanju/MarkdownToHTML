##Good Afternoon, everyone!

My name is Sameer Valanju, and I joined Tecnimont just two months ago. I’m very excited to be part of the team and contribute my experience.

I have over five years of experience in the tech industry. Before joining Tecnimont, I worked as a .NET Developer, where my role was to design and develop scalable web applications using .NET MVC and SQL Server for the backend.

And a, prior to that, I was working as a Technical Support Engineer where I spent almost over 2 yrs providing support for production issues, patch deployment activities, and maintaning app servers.

Also, I had worked on different technologies like, Angular, TypeScript, MySQL, Postgres, Azure DevOps, Entity Framework, Github, Android Studio, Java, a Firebase and more.

I’m always ready to explore and learn new tools and technologies. I look forward to collaborating with all of you and contributing to our projects at Tecnimont.

Thank you!
