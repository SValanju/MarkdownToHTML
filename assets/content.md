### Hello, everyone!
\
*My name is **Sameer Valanju**, and I am a **Senior Dotnet Developer** currently working in Tecnimont as an Engineer. (I joined Tecnimont just [TIMESTAMP] ago.)*

*I have over 5 years of experience in the tech industry. Before joining Tecnimont, I worked as a .NET Developer, where my role was to design and develop scalable web applications using .NET ecosystem and SQL Server, Postgres for backend.*

*Also, I had worked on different technologies like, Angular, TypeScript, MySQL, Postgres, Azure DevOps, Entity Framework, Github, Python, Android Studio, Java, a Firebase and more.*

*Currently, In Tecnimont, I am responsible for designing & developing scalable enterprise-grade software/web apps tailored for engineering disciplines such as Civil & Piping. I develop solutions that streamline workflows and integrate with third-party platforms like **Tekla Structures, Autodesk** and other engineering applications into our internal systems, enabling better collaboration and automation across engineering processes.*

*I am also a core team member of the AI Integration team at Tecnimont, where we identify AI use cases and develop AI Agents and MCP servers to automate engineering tasks and operations.*

*With a strong foundation in the .NET ecosystem (ASP.NET Core, C#, Entity Framework), along with front-end technologies, I aim to deliver scalable, user-centric applications that support complex engineering operations, data visualization, and project lifecycle management.*

***Thank you!***
