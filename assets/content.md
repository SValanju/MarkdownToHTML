### Good Afternoon, everyone!

*My name is **Sameer Valanju**, and I joined Tecnimont just [TIMESTAMP] ago. And a, Iâ€™m very excited to be part of the team and contribute my experience.*

*I have over 5 years of experience in the tech industry. Before joining Tecnimont, I worked as a .NET Developer, where my role was to design and develop scalable web applications using .NET MVC and SQL Server for the backend.*

*And a, prior to that, I was working as a Technical Support Engineer where I spent almost over 2 yrs providing support for production issues, patch deployment activities, and maintaning app servers.*

*Also, I had worked on different technologies like, Angular, TypeScript, MySQL, Postgres, Azure DevOps, Entity Framework, Github, Android Studio, Java, a Firebase and more.*
